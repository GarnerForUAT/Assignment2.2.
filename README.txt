All files within this repository are required for the website pages to work.

The 5 files within the images folder, are for the images on the website to be displayed. All characters, and backgrounds within the images shown on the site were all rendered in the program Blender.

The slideshow animations are operated from the code within file, slideshow.css. Said file that is responsible for the special graphics, and graphic effects of the slideshow page itself.

The code functions for the two buttons below the slideshow, previous and next tabs to alternate between images, is called from the file, slideshow.js. The most important file to this entire project.

The index html page has its own respected css file, Style.css that operates the special graphic effects on that page.
